# KNN and KPIECE Algorithms
## Kristine Pham and Thais I. Velazquez
This repo contains the 
- CPU and GPU implementations of KPIECE and KNN
- Report on these two algorithms
- 
### How to Run the Code
To run the code, run the cells in each notebook.

### Contributions
Kristine Pham worked on the KNN algorithm while Thais I. Velazquez worked on the KPIECE algorithm.

### AI Disclosure
LLMs were referenced to understand new C++/CUDA functions and structures and learn how to implement them in practice.

### References
stackoverflow and GeeksforGeeks were referenced for debugging and learning how to implement C++/CUDA functions.
